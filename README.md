# Renewable-Energy-Systems-Study
Overview

This repository presents a comparative study of three renewable energy systems: wind, hydropower, and solar. The analysis includes the processing of environmental and resource data, estimation of annual energy production, and evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility of each system. All performance results are organized into separate Excel sheets for clarity and comparison.

Wind Energy System Analysis

This section examines wind energy potential at a selected site. Wind measurement data is processed to determine key wind characteristics and to construct representative turbine power curves. Annual energy output is estimated for different turbine types, followed by an assessment of their economic viability.

Hydropower Plant Design Study

This part focuses on the conceptual design of a small-scale hydroelectric plant. Hydrological data such as river flow and seasonal variations is analyzed to quantify available water resources. Using these inputs, annual energy production is calculated and the feasibility of the installation is evaluated through basic economic analysis.

Solar Energy System Study

This section evaluates the performance of a photovoltaic system. Solar irradiance and environmental parameters are processed to estimate expected electricity generation. System efficiency, sustainability considerations, and the feasibility of different PV configurations are examined to determine the most suitable solution for the site.

Data & Methods

All environmental datasets—including wind speed measurements, hydrological data, and solar irradiance—were processed using Excel. Annual energy production, performance metrics, and feasibility assessments for each renewable system are documented in separate Excel files. All calculations are carried out using standard engineering practices and S.I. units.
